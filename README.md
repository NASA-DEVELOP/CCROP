# CCROP
Cover Crop Remotely Observed Performance (CCROP): The Maryland Department of Agriculture (MDA) is interested 
in verifying winter cover crop implementation and analyzing cover crop productivity using satellite imagery. 
As they do not have the expertise on-site to automate the process, we used a combination of scripting using 
JavaScript in Google Earth Engine (GEE) and ArcGIS to identify suitable Landsat and Sentinel images, extract 
individual farm field characters (such as values for various bands, NDVI, and red-edge) to a table, and export 
this table. Subsequently, this table will be incorporated in the MDA agronomic database where crop and farm 
productivity reports can be created as needed.

This work was part of the NASA DEVELOP Chesapeak Bay Agriculture project at NASA Goddard Space Flight Center in
Spring 2017.
